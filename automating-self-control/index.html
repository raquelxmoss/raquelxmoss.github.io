      <h2>Self-Control is easier if you don't have to think about it</h2>
      <p>TL;DR, <a href="https://github.com/raquelxmoss/dotfiles/blob/master/.selfcontrol.sh">here's</a> the script you're looking for to automate SelfControl on macOS.</p>

<p>For the past few years I've been using the excellent open-source app SelfControl to help with keeping me on task and maybe salvaging a skerrick of my attention span (it's a work-in-progress).</p>

<p>SelfControl blocks distracting websites at a fairly low level on your machine. You can't just swap to a different browser, or edit a configuration block to get to twitter, you've just got to sit there and wait. Amongst other things, SelfControl edits your /etc/hosts file, and does a few other things to prevent you from outsmarting it.</p>

<p>The thing is, in order for SelfControl to work, you do actually have to turn it on. And this is so often where I stumbled–it's both very easy and very tempting to not turn the app on. Around December last year I decided to take that decision (or lack thereof) away from myself by setting an automatic schedule for Self-Control to obey, say, 8am to 4pm on weekdays. I used an open-source Python tool to achieve this, but it broke at some point in the last few months, after an OS update.</p>

<p>I had a look at the Python library's GitHub repo to see if I could fix the issue, but I got lost in the weeds. Instead I decided to automate it with cron.*</p>

<p>The script and some brief instructions are <a href="https://github.com/raquelxmoss/dotfiles/blob/master/.selfcontrol.sh">here</a>.</p>

<p>The SelfControl repo provides <a href="https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/Running-SelfControl-from-the-Terminal">some instructions</a> on how to run the app from the command line:</p>

<p>The first line sets up the length of the block in minutes (in the example, 2 hours). The second line sets up the sites that will be blocked, so you’ll want to tweak that to your own particular vices.</p>

<p>On line four you run the app as root.</p>

<p>You can save those lines as a bash script (don’t forget to make it executable), and store it in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.*</p>

<p>The trick to getting this to run on a cron schedule is that you need to do so as root.</p>

<p>To achieve that, crack open <code>sudo crontab -e</code>, put in your password, and then add something along these lines:</p>

<p>That’s going to run at 8am every day, which suits me. If you alter the schedule, use <a href="https://crontab.guru/">crontab.guru</a> to make sure you’ve got the expression right.</p>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>You can probably do something clever to set different schedules for different days, or weekends vs weekdays, and I’ll probably experiment with that over the weekend. In any case, I hope this helps and let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/raquelxmoss">twitter</a> if you run into any problems.</p>

<p>* I know cron is deprecated on MacOS but it works for now and I’m too old/cranky/lazy to learn to do it the new way until I’m forced to when this breaks.</p>

<p>* Shout out to my co-worker Adam for helping me figure out where to store it</p>
