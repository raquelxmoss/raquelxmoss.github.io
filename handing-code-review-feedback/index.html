      <h2>Handing Code Review Feedback</h2>
      <p>When it comes to code review, the advice generally given is ‚Äòcritique the code, not the coder‚Äô and ‚Äòremember, critiques of your code are not personal attacks‚Äô.</p>

<p>Those are things that most of us know intellectually.</p>

<p>But when it comes to <em>really knowing these things emotionally</em>, how many of us struggle?</p>

<p>What if, despite our best efforts, some of us still feel terrible when our code is critiqued? What if we have a hard time dealing with that emotionally?</p>

<hr />

<p>I‚Äôve thought a lot about how my own mental health issues have had an effect on how I embrace or reject criticism. The notion that ‚Äòcritiques of your code are not personal attacks‚Äô took me a long time to internalise.</p>

<p>Over the years, I‚Äôve developed a few techniques that have helped me get better at accepting feedback on my work, so I thought I‚Äôd share them with you.</p>

<p>First, let me tell you a few specifics about my mental health: when I began programming professionally, I was in a bad place with my mental health. Many years of anxiety and depression were catching up with me, and I hit rock bottom when I realised that I was codependent and I needed help to recover.</p>

<p>I started seeing a counsellor, and together we worked on a lot of things. My mental health improved to the point where at the moment, my anxiety is very low, my depression is temporal, and I‚Äôve unlearned a lot of harmful behaviours. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this.</p>

<p>On the list of behaviours that codependents often exhibit are these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they judge what they think, say, or do harshly, as never good enough.</li>
  <li>they value others‚Äô approval of their thinking, feelings, and behaviour over their own.</li>
</ul>

<p>Certainly, these behaviours are not the exclusive territory of codependents, and I‚Äôm sure that many of you can relate to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, what used to go through my mind when the code review feedback came in?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>This person thinks I‚Äôm a terrible developer</em></li>
  <li><em>Why didn‚Äôt I already know that? I am a bad developer</em></li>
  <li><em>[other developer] would have done a much better job on this feature</em></li>
  <li><em>I am so stupid for not already knowing this</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>I bet that sounds familiar to some of you, though.</p>

<p>Not only was I beating myself up, I was also doing what my therapist would call <a href="http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/common-cognitive-distortions-mind-reading">mind-reading</a>. I would take any innocuous feedback that the reviewer gave, and assume the worst.</p>

<p>Lacking confidence, and believing in my own crap-ness as a person meant that I would take helpful feedback and invent shades of meaning that the author never intended.</p>

<p>I would spiral into shame, my anxiety would take over, and I would be an internal wreck. I hated feeling like that all the time. I hated feeling anxious about submitting my work for review.</p>

<p>When there was a bug in my work, all hell broke loose. Driven by shame, I would work feverishly at night to correct my mistakes. I would berate myself for hours and cry myself to sleep.</p>

<p>Things were bad.</p>

<hr />

<p>Things started getting better.</p>

<p>During my therapy sessions, I worked a lot on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reframing">cognitive reframing</a>. Essentially, cognitive reframing involves recognising irrational and damaging thoughts, and challenging them. For me, the short-term goal was to stop the shame spirals before they got going. The long-term goal was to change my thought patterns and establish healthier neural pathways.</p>

<p>Though I mostly focussed on personal topics in therapy, I began to use cognitive reframing to help me with my work. So, here‚Äôs the weird trick:</p>

<h1 id="i-started-thanking-people-for-their-code-review-feedback-and-for-reporting-issues-to-me">I started thanking people for their code review feedback and for reporting issues to me.</h1>

<p>It seems pretty simple and obvious, but making a conscious effort to do so served a few important purposes.</p>

<p>The step of saying ‚Äòthank you‚Äô helped me stop and reflect. It forced me to take a moment to appreciate the process. Code review and reporting issues are processes that help me learn and produce better work as a developer. Skipping a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô meant that I would jump right to the specifics of the review, without appreciating the purpose of the process.</p>

<p>Focussing on the purpose of the process helped me to depersonalise the critiques, and I started to view everything in a more collaborative way. It was me and the reviewer working together to make the code better ‚Äî not the reviewer shitting on my code and looking down upon me.</p>

<p>Over time, I‚Äôve become much more calm, rational, and welcoming of feedback (though I still have a way to go, I‚Äôm definitely not an expert).</p>

<p>So, give it a try.</p>

<p>If thanking your colleagues aloud or over chat seems too difficult and awkward at first, just do it silently in your head. You‚Äôll eventually find a way to express it that works for you.</p>

<p>To be absolutely clear, I think there‚Äôs an onus on your team and your company‚Äôs management to make sure that a good critique culture develops. None of this individual work is possible without the support of a team that collaborates, avoids personal blame, and encourages each other.</p>

<p>I also think it‚Äôs also a good idea to take a look at your own responses to criticism so that you can become a more resilient and healthy coder.</p>

<p>Let me know how it goes ‚úåüèª</p>
